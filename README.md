Deep in builder mode  learning how real systems scale by designing and breaking them.  
I focus on backend orchestration, developer tooling, and understanding systems from first principles instead of treating frameworks as magic.

I enjoy projects where theory meets production: workflows, internal tools, and architectures that don’t collapse under real-world failure.

### Current Projects
**[Luma](https://github.com/Girma35/luma)** -A RAG-powered agent using LangGraph, FastAPI, and AWS Bedrock (Llama 3.2).

**[OrderFlow](https://github.com/Girma35/OrderFlow)** – an event-driven order orchestration engine for multi-tenant commerce  

**[STEM Ethiopia](https://github.com/Girma35/Stem-Ethiopia)** – an AI-powered adaptive learning platform for Ethiopian STEM students, built with Flutter and Appwrite, featuring personalized learning paths, skill assessments, gamification, and community-driven collaboration  

**[Clicker](https://github.com/Girma35/clicker)** – a user-driven, AI-enhanced Chrome extension for ethical web scraping, featuring Gemini AI-powered element detection, pattern recognition, table scraping, infinite scroll support, and workflow recording, with live previews and export options in JSON/CSV  

**[PitchCraft](https://github.com/Girma35/pitchcraft)** – an AI-powered outreach tool that scrapes LinkedIn company profiles, stores raw data in Supabase, and generates personalized emails with optional AI analysis  

**[Better_cursor](https://github.com/Girma35/Better_cursor)** – an AI-assisted coding environment exploring better feedback loops between editors and agents

**[Sora free watermark remover](https://github.com/Girma35/sora2-free-watermark-remover)** – A specialized extraction framework engineered to detect and eliminate embedded watermarks from OpenAI's Sora 2 AI-generated video content. Utilizing frequency domain analysis and pattern recognition, this tool achieves clinical removal without degrading visual fidelity.

### How I Build

- **Safety-First AI:** Guardrails and validation layers before LLM execution  
- **Asynchronous over Synchronous:** Events over fragile API chains  
- **Failure as a first-class design input:** Designing for agent hallucinations  
- **Observability before optimization:** Tracking token usage and agent traces  
- **Documentation as part of the system**

---

### What I'm Doing Now

- Designing **Secure AI Database Agents** with restricted tool access  
- Studying distributed systems by building them  
- Creating tools I personally want to use  
- Reading architecture docs more than tutorials  
- Learning when *not* to add complexity

---

### Interests

- Distributed systems  
- AI Agent Orchestration  
- Backend architecture & pgvector  
- Developer experience (DX)  
- AI as infrastructure, not hype  
- Understanding how editors, CLIs, and backends really work

---

### Philosophy

"Make the system observable, or it doesn’t really exist."

---

### Random Facts

- Prefers logs over dashboards  
- Enjoys tracing bugs across services  
- Believes simplicity is usually discovered late  
- Builds to understand, not to impress
