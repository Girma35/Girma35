Hi, I'm Girma Wakeyo 👋  
📍 Ethiopia | 🧠 Systems-minded builder | ⚙️ Event-driven & tooling curious

Deep in builder mode — learning how real systems scale by designing and breaking them.  
I focus on backend orchestration, developer tooling, and understanding systems from first principles instead of treating frameworks as magic.

I enjoy projects where theory meets production: workflows, internal tools, and architectures that don’t collapse under real-world failure.

Current Projects

🧠 [Better_cursor](https://github.com/Girma35/Better_cursor) – an AI-assisted coding environment exploring better feedback loops between editors and agents

📦 [OrderFlow](https://github.com/Girma35/OrderFlow) – an event-driven order orchestration engine for multi-tenant commerce

How I Build

I prefer asynchronous over synchronous  
Events over fragile API chains  
Failure as a first-class design input  
Observability before optimization  
Documentation as part of the system

---

What I'm Doing Now

Designing scalable backend workflows  
Studying distributed systems by building them  
Creating tools I personally want to use  
Reading architecture docs more than tutorials  
Learning when *not* to add complexity

---

Interests

Distributed systems  
Event orchestration  
Backend architecture  
Developer experience (DX)  
AI as infrastructure, not hype  
Understanding how editors, CLIs, and backends really work

---

Philosophy

"Make the system observable, or it doesn’t really exist."

Random Facts

Prefers logs over dashboards  
Enjoys tracing bugs across services  
Believes simplicity is usually discovered late  
Builds to understand, not to impress
