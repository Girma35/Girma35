Deep in builder mode — learning how real systems scale by designing and breaking them.  
I focus on backend orchestration, developer tooling, and understanding systems from first principles instead of treating frameworks as magic.

I enjoy projects where theory meets production: workflows, internal tools, and architectures that don’t collapse under real-world failure.

### Current Projects

**[Better_cursor](https://github.com/Girma35/Better_cursor)** – an AI-assisted coding environment exploring better feedback loops between editors and agents  

**[OrderFlow](https://github.com/Girma35/OrderFlow)** – an event-driven order orchestration engine for multi-tenant commerce  

**[STEM Ethiopia](https://github.com/Girma35/Stem-Ethiopia)** – an AI-powered adaptive learning platform for Ethiopian STEM students, built with Flutter and Appwrite, featuring personalized learning paths, skill assessments, gamification, and community-driven collaboration  

**[Clicker](https://github.com/Girma35/clicker)** – a user-driven, AI-enhanced Chrome extension for ethical web scraping, featuring Gemini AI-powered element detection, pattern recognition, table scraping, infinite scroll support, and workflow recording, with live previews and export options in JSON/CSV  

**[PitchCraft](https://github.com/Girma35/pitchcraft)** – an AI-powered outreach tool that scrapes LinkedIn company profiles, stores raw data in Supabase, and generates personalized emails with optional AI analysis  

**[Sora free watermark remover](https://github.com/Girma35/sora2-free-watermark-remover)** – A specialized extraction framework engineered to detect and eliminate embedded watermarks from OpenAI's Sora 2 AI-generated video content. Utilizing frequency domain analysis and pattern recognition, this tool achieves clinical removal without degrading visual fidelity.

How I Build

I prefer asynchronous over synchronous  
Events over fragile API chains  
Failure as a first-class design input  
Observability before optimization  
Documentation as part of the system

---

What I'm Doing Now

Designing scalable backend workflows  
Studying distributed systems by building them  
Creating tools I personally want to use  
Reading architecture docs more than tutorials  
Learning when *not* to add complexity

---

Interests

Distributed systems  
Event orchestration  
Backend architecture  
Developer experience (DX)  
AI as infrastructure, not hype  
Understanding how editors, CLIs, and backends really work

---

Philosophy

"Make the system observable, or it doesn’t really exist."

---

Random Facts

Prefers logs over dashboards  
Enjoys tracing bugs across services  
Believes simplicity is usually discovered late  
Builds to understand, not to impress
